## ðŸŽ¨ Design Improvements

### Quick Filter Buttons
```typescript
// Enhanced styling with dark mode support
sx={{
  borderRadius: 3,
  border: `2px solid ${alpha(theme.palette.primary.main, 0.2)}`,
  bgcolor: theme.palette.mode === 'dark' 
    ? 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)' 
    : 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)',
  backdropFilter: 'blur(10px)',
  transition: 'all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)',
  '&.Mui-selected': {
    background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #7c3aed 0%, #06b6d4 100%)',
    transform: 'translateY(-2px)',
    boxShadow: '0 8px 25px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.2)'
  }
}}
```

### Priority System Logic
```typescript
// Always prioritize nearby products when user location is available
if (userLocation) {
  const aIsNearby = nearbyProducts.some(nearby => nearby._id === a._id);
  const bIsNearby = nearbyProducts.some(nearby => nearby._id === b._id);
  
  if (aIsNearby && !bIsNearby) return -1;
  if (!aIsNearby && bIsNearby) return 1;
  
  // Sort nearby products by distance
  if (aIsNearby && bIsNearby) {
    // Calculate and compare distances
  }
}
```

## ðŸš€ Key Features

### 1. **Smart Product Prioritization**
- **Location-Aware**: Automatically detects user location and prioritizes nearby products
- **Fallback Handling**: Gracefully handles cases where location is not available

- **Real-time Updates**: Refreshes location and re-sorts products when location changes

### 2. **Enhanced Filter Experience**
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of active filters and product counts
- **Smooth Animations**: Elegant hover effects and transitions
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on mobile and desktop
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast ratios and touch-friendly targets

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Location Priority Algorithm
```typescript
// Enhanced sorting with location-based priority
result.sort((a, b) => {
  // ALWAYS prioritize nearby products first when user location is available
  if (userLocation) {
    const aIsNearby = nearbyProducts.some(nearby => nearby._id === a._id);
    const bIsNearby = nearbyProducts.some(nearby => nearby._id === b._id);
    
    if (aIsNearby && !bIsNearby) return -1;
    if (!aIsNearby && bIsNearby) return 1;
    
    // If both are nearby, sort by distance
    if (aIsNearby && bIsNearby) {
      // Calculate distances and sort accordingly
    }
  }
  
  // Apply regular sorting for non-location-based criteria
  // ...
});
```

### Dark Mode Styling
```typescript
// Consistent dark mode support across all filter elements
const getFilterStyles = (theme, isSelected, isDisabled) => ({
  bgcolor: theme.palette.mode === 'dark' 
    ? 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)' 
    : 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)',
  color: theme.palette.mode === 'dark' 
    ? 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9)' 
    : 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)',
  border: `2px solid ${alpha(theme.palette.primary.main, 0.2)}`,
  // ... additional styling
});
```

## ðŸ“Š Results
